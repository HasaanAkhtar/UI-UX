# UI-UX
A prototype I designed using Adobe XD wireframe for the purpose of assisting medical team and dementia patient to have a more independent life without being escorted. The application focuses on tracking patientâ€™s location, his medics, scheduled appointments, medical data such as his pulses (real time data being transmitted through smart watch). In any event either party, the end user or the medics team can choose to locate the patient and call emergency services depending upon real time data.
